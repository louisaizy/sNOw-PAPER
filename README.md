# sNOw-PAPER
a paper snowflake simulator

Paper snowflakes can be messy and may not turn out great for those who are not experts at crafting. sNOw PAPER guides the user to make only perfect triangles that unfold into a mathematically symmetrical product, which they can take a screenshot of to share. Furthermore, this system has the added interest of something that you cannot do on paper, which is that you can make cuts when the snowflake is unfolded and see the results instantaneously, which can be very satisfying. 

To run this code in the Processing IDE is very easyâ€”all you have to do is open the pde file and click the run button.  

Furthermore, there is an HTML file in the folder that can be opened locally in Google Chrome, and you can see the product in a browser, refreshing the page to start over.
